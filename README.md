Monokai-High-Contrast

Color Scheme for Sublime Text

Do you like using your Mac with inverted colors, but still want to use the classic Monokai color scheme for Sublime Text? I did, so I came up with this (pretty dang close to Monokai) color scheme using this cool [TmTheme Editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#/local/Monokai).

How It Works
------------

**Step 1 -** Invert the colors on your Mac. Don't know how to invert the colors? Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Accessibility and tick the "Invert Colors" box. Now you can use the shortcut Command + Control + Option + 8 to invert your colors. I found that trick out from [this article](http://www.maclife.com/article/features/10_coolest_keyboard_shortcuts_you_never_knew_about).

**Step 2 -** Grab this theme by cloning, copying, or however you like. 

**Step 3 -** Install the theme with [Color Sublime](http://colorsublime.com/how-to-install-a-theme)
